Expansion
#########
The expansion of a node *n* means that each successor node *m* of *n* is checked: if *m* has not been visited, it is visited now and recorded for further (recursive) expansion.

Admissible heuristic
####################
  In computer science, specifically in algorithms related to pathfinding, a heuristic function is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path. - `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic>`_
