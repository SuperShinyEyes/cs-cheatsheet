Probabilistic modeling
======================

The goal of probabilistic modeling:

* Classify the samples into groups
* Create prediction for future observations
* Select between competing hypothesis
* Estimate a parameter, such as the mean of a population  

How do we run probabilistic modeling?

#. Models: Bayesian networks, Sparse Bayesian linear regression, Gaussian mixture models, latent linear models
#. Methods for inference: max likelihood, max a posteriori(MAP), Laplace approx., expectation maximization(EM), Variational Bayes(VB), Stochastic variational inference(SVI)
#. And choose a way to select different models based on your inference and update your model!
